              I am an Actor, Content Creator, and Model who was born and raised in Harlem, New York, to Ivorian immigrants. I did not see much positivity in the environment I grew up in; dealing with economic hardship, violence, gangs, and drugs; as well as classism and racism. To capture a break from reality, I looked to film, TV, and video games.
